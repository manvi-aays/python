# python

question 1.
write a function to calculate the factorial of a number
extra points for using recursion
please do not use chat-gpt, [google to understand the maths if required]
function signature: 
factorial(int)-> int
write 3 test cases using unittest
NOTE: factorial of a number x [denoted as x!] is x*(x-1)*(x-2)...*3*2*1
      eg: 4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24
 
 
question 2.
write a function that takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a list containing squares of the numbers in the input
eg:
input = [0,1,2,3]
output = [0,1,4,9]
use for loops
write 3 test cases using pytest
 
question 3.
write the above [question 2] code using list comprehension
write 3 test cases [any framework is ok]
